The point of the game is to have fun. TicTacToe game consists of 9 buttons which you need to press to start playing. The game is made for 2 players who have to choose who want to be the player "X" or player "O". In my game, there you have more ways to win. If you connect a line of 3 of your symbols, you will win the game. The lines can be as rows, columns, main diagonal or secondary diagonal. If you end by draw, you have to press a button "Clear", which restart the game and you can play many times you want.
